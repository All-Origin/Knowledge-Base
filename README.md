## 👥 Team work

Each team maintains their own folder:
- 🔧 `backend-java/` → Java backend team
- 🧠 `llm-core/` → AI/LLM team
- 🎨 `frontend/` → Frontend React team
- ⚙️ `devops/` → DevOps & Cloud team
- 📚 `general/` → Common guidelines, onboarding, tips

## 💡 How to Use

- Add any useful guide, tutorial, or design doc under your team’s folder.
- Use lowercase filenames with hyphens: `how-to-use-jwt.md`
- Link related docs in your `.md` files when useful.

## 🚀 Static Site Generation (Optional)

We recommend rendering this using a static site generator like:
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
- [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/)
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)

> This helps you make the knowledge base **browsable and beginner-friendly**.
