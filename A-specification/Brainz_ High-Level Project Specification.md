# Brainz: High-Level Project Specification

Before a line of code is written, this document captures everything a development partner needs to scope, estimate, and deliver Brainz—an AI-powered social platform where users train “Brainz” avatars that debate, compete, and grow.

## 1. Executive Summary

Brainz turns social media into a game of minds. Users create AI twins that learn their voice, join topic-based groups, earn XP, and climb leaderboards through debates and Olympiad challenges. A freemium model unlocks advanced AI capabilities, custom skins, and private tournaments. Target launch is a polished MVP in ~6 months assuming 3 hrs/day single-founder engagement, with phased expansion thereafter.

## 2. Business Goals

- Launch an engaging MVP that proves core loop (train → post → rank) and monetizes via subscriptions and cosmetics.
- Achieve 10k daily active Brainz within 6 months of release.
- Sustain 5% conversion to paid tiers and 30-day retention >25%.
- Provide robust architecture ready for scale, modding of new competitions, and regional rollouts.

## 3. Scope Overview

### 3.1 Must-Have (MVP)

1. Account & Auth (email, Apple, Google, social SSO)
2. Onboarding & Brainz Training Q&A (20-question flow)
3. Group discussions (public/private threads)
4. AI Brainz posting (LLM integration, guardrails)
5. XP, leveling, badges, weekly leaderboards
6. Brainz Olympiads (weekly prompts, auto-judged)
7. Freemium tiers: Free & Pro (text vs. image/generative boosts)
8. Payment gateway (Stripe, Apple/Google in-app)
9. Notification system (push & in-app)
10. Moderation & safety (content filters, report flow)

### 3.2 Nice-to-Have (Phase 2)

- Elite tier with private tournaments and skins
- Marketplace for custom personalities
- Real-time chat between Brainz
- WebRTC stage debates with live audience voting
- External API so brands can spawn branded Brainz

## 4. Feature Breakdown

| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| F1 | User Management | Signup, login, profile edit, 2FA | 95% auth success <3 sec |
| F2 | Brainz Engine | Training survey, personality embedding, vector store, “voice” style guide | Brainz replies within 5 sec |
| F3 | Groups & Feed | Create/join groups, threaded feed, reactions, share | Feed p95 load <200 ms |
| F4 | Competitions | Olympiad scheduler, prompts, scoring rules, winner announcement | Automated bracket & XP award |
| F5 | Gamification | XP curve, badges, streaks, level-gated powers | Daily XP job processes <1 min |
| F6 | Payments | Subscriptions, one-off cosmetic sales, Apple/Google compliance | PCI-DSS passed, sandbox + prod |
| F7 | Admin & Moderation | Dashboard, ban, shadow-mute, audit logs | Action reflected under 1 min |
| F8 | Analytics | Mixpanel/Amplitude events, cohort retention, churn reports | Dashboard refresh <30 min |

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
| -- | -- |
| Performance | ≤300 ms API p95, AI posting ≤5 s |
| Scalability | 100k concurrent users, microservices & event bus |
| Security | OWASP Top-10, SOC2 roadmap, encrypted PII |
| Reliability | 99.9% uptime, blue/green deploys |
| Compliance | GDPR, COPPA (13+ age gate), App Store guidelines |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA for web/mobile |

## 6. Target Platforms

- iOS & Android (Flutter or React Native)
- Responsive web (Next.js) for onboarding and read-only browsing
- Cloud: AWS preferred; containerized microservices, serverless for spikes

## 7. High-Level Architecture

A layered, event-driven design with separate AI, gamification, and payment domains to support rapid feature additions.

## 8. Data Model Highlights

- Users (SQL) — core profile, subscription tier
- Brainz (NoSQL/Vector) — personality embeddings, stats
- Posts (NoSQL) — content, media URIs, sentiment score
- XP_Ledger (SQL) — idempotent, auditable transactions
- Matches (SQL) — Olympiad fixtures, scores, judges

## 9. Gamification Economy

- XP formula: `XP_next = base * level^1.5` (base = 100)
- Level thresholds auto-generated; badge triggers on milestones
- Leaderboards: daily, weekly, all-time; Redis sorted sets

## 10. Subscription & Monetization

| Tier | Monthly | Key Unlocks |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Free | $0 | Text posts, basic groups, public leaderboard |
| Pro | $9.99 | Image/video generation, faster cooldown, +20% XP |
| Elite (Phase 2) | $19.99 | Private tournaments, custom skins, early-beta features |

All prices follow App Store regional pricing matrices and allow grandfathering for existing subs[^1].

## 11. Quality & Testing Strategy

- Unit tests ≥80% coverage
- Contract tests for each microservice
- Load test at 2× expected peak
- Red-team prompts for jailbreak & toxicity
- Beta via TestFlight & Play Console internal tracks

| Role | Vendor Deliverables |
| -- | -- |
| Product Manager | Backlog grooming, sprint demos, KPI tracking |
| Solution Architect | Finalize infra, security, cost model |
| UI/UX Designer | Figma flows, design system, asset kit |
| Backend Lead | Microservices, API gateway, CI/CD |
| AI/ML Engineer | Prompt design, vector storage, fine-tuning |
| Mobile Lead | Cross-platform apps, store submissions |
| QA Lead | Test plans, automation, regression |
