# 🧠 LLM Core Team – Overview

The **LLM Core Team** is at the heart of Brainz’s AI innovation — responsible for everything related to large language models (LLMs), AI agents, and digital personality behavior.

## 🔍 Responsibilities
- Designing LLM prompt templates and fine-tuning strategies.
- Defining digital personalities and behavior traits.
- Handling context memory and long-term learning.
- Building safety, moderation, and ethical safeguards.
- Measuring quality with evaluation metrics.

## 📘 Documentation Includes
- LLM personality architecture and system design.
- Prompt engineering frameworks.
- Token usage and context window strategies.
- Evaluation and feedback loops.
- Internal APIs for LLM invocation.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
- OpenAI, Claude, LLaMA, or custom LLMs
- Python (for experiments)
- Vector databases (e.g., Chroma, Weaviate)
- LangChain, Transformers, or RAG frameworks

> 📎 All LLM behavior, training flows, and persona templates must be version-controlled and documented for reproducibility and auditability.
